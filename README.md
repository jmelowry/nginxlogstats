# nginxlogstats

## Summary

* Read and summarize nginx access logs. 
* This is just a proof-of-concept, and only works w/ default nginx access.log files. 
* An additional function would need to be added to either define the log format, or parse nginx config file(s) in order to support custom access.log output.

## Installation

`pip install https://github.com/jmelowry/nginx-log-stats/archive/master.zip`

## Usage

`nls <logfile>`
